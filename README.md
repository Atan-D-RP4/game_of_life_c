# Project Title: <em>Hot-Reloadable</em> Graphics Simulations using Raylib
## Programmer: Chaitanya Dubakula
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/r0Qm7iD3AW4
#### Description:
A collection of simulations written and built purely in C using raylib. Fully
hot-reloadable, meaning that the simulations can be reloaded without restarting,
using a custom framework written in a single header library.

Each simulation is compiled into a shared library, which is then loaded by the
main program at run-time.
